Abstraction API for RPG plugins.
MimicAPI is independent of any platform.

## What is MimicAPI?
I faced the problem there is a lot of RPG plugins and I need to get a copy of these plugins (some of which are paid) somehow to integrate my plugins with them.  
And, inspired by [Vault](https://github.com/MilkBowl/Vault), I started writing MimicAPI.  
With Mimic you needn't download all RPG plugins and write specified code for each plugin to support them, just use Mimic as dependency.

## Implementations

BukkitMimic - Implementation of MimicAPI for Bukkit.
