Abstraction API for Bukkit RPG plugins

## What is Mimic?
I faced the problem there is a lot of RPG plugins and I need to get a copy of these plugins (some of which are paid) somehow to integrate my plugins with them.  
And, inspired by [Vault](https://github.com/MilkBowl/Vault), I started writing Mimic.  
With Mimic you needn't download all RPG plugins and write specified code for each plugin to support them, just use Mimic as dependency.

## How to include Mimic (Maven, Gradle, sbt, Leiningen)
To include this API to your project use [JitPack repository](https://jitpack.io/#ru.endlesscode/MimicAPI).
