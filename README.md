# Mimic 
Abstraction API for Bukkit RPG plugins

## What is Mimic?
I encountered a problem that there is a lot of RPG plugins and to add in my plugin ability to use classes or levels from them, 
I need to somehow get a copy of these plugins (some of which are paid). It is bad.  
And, inspired by [Vault](https://github.com/MilkBowl/Vault), I started writing Mimic.  
With Mimic you not needed download all RPG plugins and write specified code for each plugin to support them, just use Mimic as dependecy.
